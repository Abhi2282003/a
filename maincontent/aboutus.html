<h1>ABOUT US</h1>

<p>Our project aims to create an educational and entertaining website centered around the theme of eclipses. Eclipses, both solar and lunar, have captured the human imagination for centuries, and this website seeks to provide a comprehensive platform for learning about these celestial events while offering engaging eclipse-themed games as well as interactive stories for young visitors.  We are passionate astronomy enthusiasts and coding beginners. This website is a practical application of both our love for science and our budding coding skills.</p>
